# GEODE-remake

GEODE is a top-down 2d Survival + Tower Defense game, set in a strange world where extraterrestrial meteors have corrupted life. 
Team up with friends and try to live as long as possible, die, then come back stronger and try again. 

Being developed solo by myself, with the high quality pixel art done by Annika Stokes.
